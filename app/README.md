# This is a good place for your application logic!

I recommend something like this:
 * `app/[ModelName]/model.js` The model definition.
 * `app/[ModelName]/hook-[HookName1].js` Your first hook.
 * `app/[ModelName]/hook-[HookName2].js` Your second hook.

If you want another schema, don't forget to change this in `index.js`.
