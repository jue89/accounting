# Accounting

Due to the lack of a good name this project is just called *Accounting*. In near future it will provide a RESTful HTTPS interface for accounting stuff. And in far future it might will have a wonderful name and a helpful documentation.


## Getting Started

Install NodeJS (>= 0.10) and NPM.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jue89/accounting.git
$ npm install --production
$ npm start
```
